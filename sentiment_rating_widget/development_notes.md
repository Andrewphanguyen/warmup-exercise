### Members:

### Initial Ideas:
- A question at the top asking how the user is feeling, telling them to choose an option
- 5 different smiley faces placed in a row. Can be either satisfied/unsatisfied, angry/sad/happy, etc. they will be colored red/yellow/green accordingly
- Underneath put an indicator for the user’s selection, “you selected…”
- Have the button trigger a message depending on their selection. Celebratory for happy, or ‘hope you feel better’ for sad
- Start with the basic buttons and features for now using HTML/CSS/JS, make it more advanced or add animations if we have time later

### Incorporating AI
- Used AI to develop an initial base of code to build from
- Took a few generations before providing usable code
